# WTWR (What to Wear?) – React + Vite

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple – we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Project Stack

This app is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), with hot module replacement and ESLint integration for a smooth developer experience.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https)
